This repo contains a few list of curated feeds by "Superfeedr":http://superfeedr.com.

**June 2015**: we decided to remove these outdated lists. Yet, Superfeedr now has a "popularity rank":http://documentation.superfeedr.com/schema.html#popularity for each and every feed. Using our tracking feeds you can also very easily subscribe to the "most popular feeds":http://blog.superfeedr.com/subscribe-to-popular-rss-feeds/.
